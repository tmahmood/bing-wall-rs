# Bing wall

A simple tool to download daily bing wallpaper.

At most eight wallpapers can be downloaded from current wallpaper. Maybe more in future

In future, configs will be saved to user config folder. 

Right now it defaults to store pictures in `BingWallpaper` under user's `Picture` folder (same as Gnome Bing Wallpaper extension)

Pretty limited, but works, It's just itch a scratch
